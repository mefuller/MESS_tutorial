  abstract  = {The oxidation of surrogate diesel fuels composed of mixtures of three pure hydrocarbons with and without their cetane numbers chemically enhanced using 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (2-EHN) is studied in a variable pressure flow reactor over a temperature range 500 - 900 K, at 12.5 atmospheres and a fixed reaction time of 1.8 sec. Changes in both low temperature, intermediate temperature, and hot ignition chemical kinetic behavior are noted with changes in the fuel cetane number. Differences appear in the product distribution and in heat release generated in the low and intermediate temperature regimes as cetane number is increased. A chemically enhanced cetane fuel shows nearly identical oxidation characteristics to those obtained using pure fuel blends to produce the enhanced cetane value. The decomposition chemistry of 2-EHN was also studied. Pyrolysis data of 10% 2-EHN in -heptane and toluene are reported. Experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure in argon at temperatures from 400 - 850 and at 12.5 atm pressure in nitrogen at temperatures from 450 - 700 K. Based upon these measurements, a phenomenological mechanism for the initial steps of 2-EHN decomposition is proposed.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT Heavy-duty engine experiments were conducted to explore reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion through addition of the cetane improver di-tertbutyl peroxide (DTBP) to pump gasoline. Unlike previous diesel/gasoline dual-fuel operation of RCCI combustion, the present study investigates the feasibility of using a single fuel stock (gasoline) as the basis for both high reactivity and low reactivity fuels. The strategy consisted of port fuel injection of gasoline and direct injection of the same gasoline doped with a small volume percent addition of DTBP. With 1.75% DTBP by volume added to only the direct-injected fuel (which accounts for approximately 0.2% of the total fueling) it was found that the additized gasoline behaved similarly to diesel fuel, allowing for efficient RCCI combustion. The single fuel results with DTBP were compared to previous high-thermal efficiency, low-emissions results with port injection of gasoline and direct injections of diesel. The comparison between fueling strategies found that the higher volatility of gasoline enabled a reduction in the direct injection pressure from 800 (bar) with diesel to 400 (bar) with gasoline. At the tested conditions, the peak gross indicated based thermal efficiency was over 57%. The emissions trends and magnitudes of the single fuel strategy were also comparable to those of the diesel/gasoline dual-fuel strategy, and both engine-out NOx and PM met EPA HD 2010 emissions mandates without aftertreatment. Also, the decreased low temperature heat release with the single fuel strategy was found to lower compression work and increased thermal efficiency by approximately 1% over the diesel/gasoline case. The results demonstrate that a very small percentage of an appropriate additive can be used to establish a sufficiency large reactivity gradient to match the performance of a dual fuel strategy when operated in the RCCI combustion regime.},

In this paper we propose that an innovative new class of heat transfer fluids can be engineered by suspending metallic nanoparticles in conventional heat transfer fluids. The resulting {open_quotes}nanofluids{close_quotes} are expected to exhibit high thermal conductivities compared to those of currently used heat transfer fluids, and they represent the best hope for enhancement of heat transfer. The results of a theoretical study of the thermal conductivity of nanofluids with copper nanophase materials are presented, the potential benefits of the fluids are estimated, and it is shown that one of the benefits of nanofluids will be dramatic reductions in heat exchanger pumping power.},
