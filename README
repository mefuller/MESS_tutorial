This folder contains the original slide deck for the MESS tutorial given on 12 May 2020.
Additionally, a stripped version was created without beamer formatting as an article.
The article is used as input to conversion with pandoc to generate (github) markdown.

Automatic conversion now enabled (but not extensively tested) for Beamer to MD:
run $ WriteMDfromBeamer.sh beamer.tex out.md
